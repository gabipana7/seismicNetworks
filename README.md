# Tools for Earthquakes Visualization and Earthquake Networks creation

In this repository you will find the necessary tools for:


## Visualization

* earthquakes epicenter visualization as 3D scatterplots on latitude, longitude and depth dimensions;
* the scatterplot points sizes and color vary according to the magnitude of the earthquakes;
* possibility to add a 2D map as a projection on the 3D plot, under the scatterplot.


## Network creation

* using graphs, seismic networks are created;
* centrality measures such as connectivity (weighted/unweighted).


## Motifs

* fundamental building blocks of graphs;
* motif detection using a slightly modified version of NemoMapPy - https://github.com/zicanl/NemoMapPy;
* motif connectivity analysis;
* motif areas and volumes distributions, weighted by total energy and mean energy released in motif;
* motif visualization using Paraview.



# COMING SOON
## Autocorrelations

* spatial autocorrelations;
* temporal autocorrelations.


## Miscellaneous

* waiting times;
* energy release distribution.
