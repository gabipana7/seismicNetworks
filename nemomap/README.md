# NemoMapPy for Seismic Networks

This is a slightly modified version of the NemoMap program, made to be integrated in our seismic networks processing package.

The main modifications are with regards to where the inputGraph files are taken from and also to the output file where the motifs are collected. 
The intent was to make this program run recurrently for a list of graphs, in order to automate the motifs discovery in seismic networks.

The original NemoMapPy (Nemomap Python port) is found here https://github.com/zicanl/NemoMapPy
